# Shelfmate

> A user-friendly library Management System for Library.

## 🚀 About The Project  
Shelfmate is a web application built to help readers organize and keep track of their books. It provides a simple, clean interface to:

- add books to your shelf  
- mark reading status (e.g. “to read”, “reading”, “finished”)  
- optionally store metadata like author, genre, notes, etc.  
- view and manage your reading list from anywhere  

It aims to make book tracking effortless — whether you’re building a “to-read” wishlist or curating your reading history.

## 🧰 Built With  
List of major frameworks / libraries used:

- JavaScript / TypeScript (or whichever you use)  
- Web front-end (HTML / CSS / any relevant framework)  
- Server backend (Node.js / Express / etc., if used)  
- Any database or storage layer (e.g. MongoDB / SQLite / JSON files — adjust accordingly)  

*(Adjust this section to match your stack.)*
